# JS-Salsa20
Pure JavaScript Salsa20 stream cipher

### Abstract
Salsa20 is a family of 256-bit stream ciphers designed in 2005
and submitted to eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project.
Salsa20 has progressed to the third round of eSTREAM without any
changes. The 20-round stream cipher Salsa20/20 is consistently faster
than AES and is recommended by the designer for typical cryptographic
applications.
